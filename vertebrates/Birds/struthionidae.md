meta: Struthionidae is a family of flightless ratite birds which first appeared during the Miocene epoch, though various Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene ratites may belong to this group. Traditionally the order Struthioniformes contained the world's ratites, but recent genetic analysis has found that the group is not monophletyic, as it paraphyletic in respect to the tinamous.
