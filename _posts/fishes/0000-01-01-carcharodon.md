meta: Carcharodon is a genus of sharks within the family Lamnidae. The only extant member of the genus is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Extinct members of the genus include Carcharodon caifassii and Carcharodon hubbelli. Carcharocles megalodon is still argued by some paleontologists (i. e. Michael D. Gottfried, and Robert Ewan Fordyce) that it is a close relative of Carcharodon carcharias. The megalodon's scientific name was originally 'Carcharodon' megalodon.
